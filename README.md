# University Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of university projects. This repository contains various projects I have worked on during my studies in Data Science and Statistics. The projects below showcase my skills in statistical modelling, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Projects

### 1. [Advanced Topics In Statistics Inference and Classification](./Advanced-Topics-In-Statistics-Inference-and-Classification)
*A detailed exploration of statistical inference and classification methods. This work covers Bayesian inferencing using JAGS and classification techniques in R. Includes a Bayesian mixture model for reaction time analysis and performance comparison of multiple classification algorithms*  

**Tools:** R, Statsmodels, Classification Algorithms, Cross-validation

### 2. [Exploring Spotify Data and Musical Attributes on Song Success](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Spotify%20Data%20and%20Musical%20Attributes%20on%20Song%20Success/FINAL%20PROJECT%20PDF.pdf)
*This project explores the relationship between musical attributes and song popularity on Spotify using statistical analysis and hierarchical modeling in R. Through data wrangling, interactive visualisations, and predictive modeling, it identifies key factors influencing stream counts across top-performing tracks* 

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, Data Visualization

### 3. [Data Modelling in Space and Time](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Spotify%20Data%20and%20Musical%20Attributes%20on%20Song%20Success/FINAL%20PROJECT%20PDF.pdf)
*A statistical modelling project exploring spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal patterns in environmental datasets using R. Includes Gaussian process modelling, time series forecasting, and Bayesian inference applied to oceanic and climatic data.*  

**Tools:** R, Geospatial Data, Temporal Modelling, Spatial Statistics

### 4. [Comparative Modelling of AIDS Trends using Gaussian and Poisson Regression](./Comparative-Modelling-of-AIDS-Trends-using-Gaussian-and-Poisson-Regression)
*Description coming soon*  

**Tools:** R, Poisson Regression, Gaussian Models, Statistical Inference

### 5. [Statistical Modelling of TB Risk Across Brazil](./Statistical-Modelling-of-TB-Risk-Across-Brazil)
*Description coming soon*  

**Tools:** R, Spatial Statistics, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), TB Data

### 6. [Exploring Plankton Health Status in the Arctic](./Exploring-Plankton-Health-Status-in-the-Arctic)
*Description coming soon*  

**Tools:** Python, Remote Sensing, Satellite Data, Environmental Analysis
