# University Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of university projects. This repository contains various projects I have worked on during my studies in Data Science and Statistics. The projects below showcase my skills in statistical modelling, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Projects

### 1. [Advanced Topics In Statistics Inference and Classification](./Advanced-Topics-In-Statistics-Inference-and-Classification)
*A detailed exploration of statistical inference and classification methods. This work covers Bayesian inferencing using JAGS and classification techniques in R. Includes a Bayesian mixture model for reaction time analysis and performance comparison of multiple classification algorithms*  

**Tools:** R, Statsmodels, Classification Algorithms, Cross-validation

### 2. [Comparative Modelling of AIDS Trends using Gaussian and Poisson Regression](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Comparative%20Modelling%20of%20AIDS%20Trends%20using%20Gaussian%20and%20Poisson%20Regression/Statistical-Modelling_Individual-Assessment.pdf)
*This project explores advanced regression modelling techniques to evaluate quarterly AIDS cases in the UK from 1983 to 1994. Beginning with Poisson and Normal models, it incorporates higher-order polynomial extensions, diagnostic testing, and model comparisons using deviance, AIC, and residual plots. The project concludes with the implementation of a Negative Binomial regression, which outperforms previous models by addressing overdispersion and providing the most statistically valid and interpretable fit. Methods include maximum likelihood estimation, likelihood ratio tests, and thorough residual diagnostics, all implemented and visualised in R.*  

**Tools:** R, Poisson Regression, Gaussian Models, Statistical Inference

### 3. [Statistical Modelling of TB Risk Across Brazil](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Statistical%20Modelling%20of%20TB%20Risk%20Across%20Brazil/Statistical_Modelling_Project.pdf)
*This project involved modelling tuberculosis (TB) incidence across Brazil's 557 microregions using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) in R. I conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled spatial and temporal data, implemented and compared Poisson and Negative Binomial GAMs to address overdispersion, and visualised non-linear effects of socio-economic predictors on TB risk. Skills demonstrated include spatial data analysis, statistical modelling, model diagnostics, geospatial visualisation, and interpretation of complex model outputs to guide public health resource allocation.*  

**Tools:** R, Spatial Statistics, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), TB Data

### 4. [Data Modelling in Space and Time](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Data%20Modelling%20in%20Space%20and%20Time/Data-Science-and-Statistical-Modelling-in-Space-and-Time---Coursework.pdf)
*A statistical modelling project exploring spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal patterns in environmental datasets using R. Includes Gaussian process modelling, time series forecasting, and Bayesian inference applied to oceanic and climatic data.*  

**Tools:** R, Geospatial Data, Temporal Modelling, Spatial Statistics

### 5. [Applications of Data Science - Gene Expression, Climate Trends, and Power Usage Patterns](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Applications%20of%20Data%20Science%20-%20Gene%20Expression%2C%20Climate%20Trends%2C%20and%20Power%20Usage%20Patterns/Final%20Project%20-%20PDF.pdf)
*A comprehensive data science project applying machine learning and statistical techniques across three domains: classifying cancer types using gene expression data, modeling global and regional sea level trends with linear regression, and segmenting electricity substations based on daily power demand using clustering algorithms. Includes PCA for dimensionality reduction, model evaluation with metrics and visualizations, and real-world interpretation of results.*

**Tools:** R, Python, Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Cluster Analysis

### 6. [Exploring Spotify Data and Musical Attributes on Song Success](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Spotify%20Data%20and%20Musical%20Attributes%20on%20Song%20Success/FINAL%20PROJECT%20PDF.pdf)
*This project explores the relationship between musical attributes and song popularity on Spotify using statistical analysis and hierarchical modeling in R. Through data wrangling, interactive visualisations, and predictive modeling, it identifies key factors influencing stream counts across top-performing tracks* 

**Tools:** R studio, Linear modelling, Machine Learning, Data Visualization

### 7. [Exploring Big Data - Ethical Reflections and Frameworks in the Age of Datafication](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Big%20Data%20-%20Ethical%20Reflections%20and%20Frameworks%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Datafication/Final%20Report%20-%20PDF.pdf)
This project explores the ethical dimensions of Big Data and data governance through a personal reflection and a critical case study analysis of the 2016 Uber data breach. It applies consequentialism and virtue ethics to evaluate corporate decision-making and the broader implications for digital trust and accountability

**Tools:** Literature Review, Critical Analysis, Ethical Frameworks

### 8. [Exploring Plankton Health Status in the Arctic](https://github.com/JoshH7042/university-projects/blob/main/Exploring%20Plankton%20Health%20Status%20in%20the%20Arctic/Final%20Repot%20-%20PDF.pdf)
*This project investigates the relationship between sea surface temperature and phytoplankton biomass in the Arctic using cross-correlation, VAR, SARIMA, and spectral analysis in R. The findings highlight the complex, non-linear drivers behind phytoplankton productivity and inform climate-related ecological policy recommendations.*  

**Tools:** R, Remote Sensing, Satellite Data, Environmental Analysis
